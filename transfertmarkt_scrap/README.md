# transfertmarkt_scrap
Web scraping utility for the transfertmarkt.de website


The idea is that the transfertmarkt.de website provides  a gigantic database on football.

I want to retrieve data from the site to analyse it and identify trends in the world of football.

This file is in the form of a poorly documented library (a set of functions with more or less explicit names).

This is a very good base to start understanding how to do python webscraping with BeautifulSoup.
